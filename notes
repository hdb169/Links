single arm experiments are good for electron scattering, and detecting those scattered electrons. If we 
wish to detect the hadrons, the photo-production (bremsstrahlung) due to electron-target interaction contribute to the 
hadron production. This means that photo-produced hadrons may dominate over the electro-produced hadrons. But, 
in coincidence experiments, the rate of photo-production might be small, and still so detected hadrons contribute to 
accidental coincidences beacuse we wont have coincident with scattered electron for such hadrons. We subtract those 
accidental coincidences. In coin expt, we tag the produced hadron with scatterd electrons, and get more pure 
electro-produced hadrons.
